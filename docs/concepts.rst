Concepts
==========

The concept behind :mod:`microbenthos`  models is to generate partial differential equations of
various analytes/variables that constitute the relationships between the entities of the model.
So the starting point for creating microbenthic models is to write down the constitutive
relationships between chemical or metabolic processes and their dependencies on environmental
conditions.

The special case of microbenthic systems emerges from the extremely steep gradients of most
environmental parameters within a few millimeters, i.e. irradiance intensity, oxygen, sulfide,
biomass, etc. Microbial mats constitute very dense, laminated populations of different microbial
groups that occupy the niches created by the microenvironments and exploit them through adapted
and specific metabolic processes.

Microbial mats are typically modelled as diffusive-reactive systems, i.e. the dominant mode of
mass transport is physical diffusion of solutes. This diffusion occurs within the porespaces of
the sediment matrix, which are considered to be occupied by microbial populations. The "reactive"
aspect refers to the presence of a large number of "local" sources and sinks within the mat
system. Indeed, a vast array of metabolic pathways can be found within a few millimeters of
microbial mats, with one population thriving off the side-products of another populations main
process. Furthermore, the various metabolisms have responses to multiple environmental
parameters, responding to some with inhibition, to others with saturation and preferences for an
optimum level. This could be with respect to light, or temperature, or oxygen or any other
environmental parameters.

MicroBenthos recognizes that while the process of physical diffusion is simple to model, the
larger challenge is to have a flexible way to experiment with *in silico* microbial mats, that
can exhibit various types of metabolic responses. So MicroBenthos helps in converting
constitutive relationships for metabolic processes, e.g. oxygenic photosynthesis is inhibited by
oxygen and sulfide and has an optimal light level, into mathematical equations and compiling
several of these into highly non-linear, coupled, partial differential equations. This is done
through symbolic computation (using :mod:`sympy`) and abstractions at the level useful for
microbial mats (sediment, diffusive boundary layer, microbial biomass, etc) and then iteratively
solving the differential equations (using :mod:`fipy`) as the model clock evolves.

The :ref:`tutorials` provide a hands-on path towards creating and studying your own *in silico*
microbial mats which can include features such as:

* solar irradiance
* photopigment absorption
* microbial metabolisms (respiration, photosynthesis, etc)
* abiotic (geo)chemical processess
* biomass synthesis and growth
* ... and more to come
